Hello and welcome to Section 5 web servers and application deployment we're covering a ton of exciting

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,290
stuff in this section.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,210
You're going to learn how to make a web server.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,160
You're going to learn how to integrate a version control into node applications.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,780
And finally you're going to learn how to deploy your node apps which means that you have a you are Alan

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,610
anyone who visits that you r l can view your application.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,730
Now do you get all that done we are going to be looking at a framework called Express.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,200
It's one of the most popular NPM libraries and for good reason it makes it really easy to do stuff like

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,590
create a web server or an h t t p API.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,290
Kind of like the dark sky API we used in the last section.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,030
Now most courses start here.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,300
They start with Express and I think that's confusing because it blurs the line between what is node

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,230
and what is Express which is why we've waited so long to talk about it.

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,840
Don't get me wrong it's a fantastic library but I wanted to wait a little bit to introduce it now that

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,960
I am introducing it.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,980
So let's go ahead and kick things off.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,130
Adding express to a brand new node app
