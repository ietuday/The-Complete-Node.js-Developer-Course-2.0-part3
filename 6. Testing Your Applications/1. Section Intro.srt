Hello and welcome to Section 7 testing your node applications and this section we're going to look at

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,740
how we can test our code to make sure it's working as expected.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,190
Now if you set up test cases for other languages then you know how hard it can be to get started.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,260
You have to set up the actual test infrastructure and then you have to write your individual test cases.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,370
Every time I didn't test an application it was because the set up process and the tools available to

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,710
me were such a burden.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,460
Then you dig around for information on line and you get really simple examples but not examples for

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,220
testing real world things like asynchronous code or express applications.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,480
We're going to be doing all of that in this section.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,990
I'm going to give you a very simple setup for testing and writing your test cases.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to look at the best tools available.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,490
So you'll actually be excited to write those test cases and see all of those green checkmarks.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,120
We're going to be testing from here on out as well.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,140
So let's go ahead and dive in looking at how we can test some code
